The following scripts generate data by solving the Fisher-KPP equation

1. Fisher-KPP-ANN.jl: fits the reaction term with a feed-forward neural network while assuming the diffusion term 

2. Fisher-KPP-ANN-D.jl: fits the reaction term with a feed-forward neural network and optimizes the diffusion coefficient simultaneously 

3. Fisher-KPP-CNN.jl: fits the reaction term with a feed-forward neural network and the diffusion term with a CNN
